# Task 4

data entry

## Description

since we have now  a working structure, now its the time to have the ability to enter data.

**BUT** is it important that this data wont persist. the persistence will be implemented later. as of now it should be just remembered as long as we are inside the screen of the corresponding entry form (which will also display the entries made, and make it able to modify the entries.)

## TO DO

implement forms_screen
implement forms_controller

add the implementations to the main_screen and main_controller (open the table by selecting via a button for each model (or other said table) existing)

move the current "view tables" button to be a debug option. whereas debug is only able to be activated with a button on the botton left corner
