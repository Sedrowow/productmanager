## Task Overview

So here is the idea:

Please write a small app that has 3 screens:

Products Screen (Here you can add products (Name, Description))
Persons Screen (Here you can add persons (First Name, Last Name))
Jobs Screen (Main Screen) Here you can write shopping orders.. you can create shopping orders here.. a person buys n products in quantity x - with a status Completed (Yes-No).

The products, persons, and jobs are persisted in an SQLite DB.

At app start, the current state is initially loaded from the DB.

All changes in the app (new/deleted person, new/deleted product, new/deleted job, changed job status) are first held in the state and not directly persisted in SQLite.
In the app, there is a "Save" button, when clicked, the state is synchronized with the DB.

How do the tables in SQLite look like?

## Answer

there will be three tables:

1. **[Products]:** here are products listed in stock with "ProductID {INT}", "Name {TEXT}", "Description {TEXT}", and "SellPrice {REAL}".
    1. ProductID will be auto increment and not null, as its a primary key
2. **[Persons]:** here are the persons (customers) listed with "CustomerID {INT}", "FirstName {TEXT}", "LastName {TEXT}"
    1. CustomerID will be auto increment and not null, as its a primary key
3. **[Jobs]:** here are the current delivery jobs and shopping orders listed with "OrderID {INT}", "OrderedBy", "OrderedProduct", "Quantity {INT}", "Status {INT}"
    1. OrderID will be auto increment and not null, as its a primary key
    2. OrderedBy is inherited from **[Persons]**CustomerID
    3. OrderedProduct is inherited from **[Products]**ProductID
    4. Quantity is not null, since you order at least 1, and never order nothing
    5. Status is True or False (yes or no), but since True and False are just translated to integers saying 1 and 0, it needs to be INT, as there is no BOOL, value in SQLite

Database Connection and Table Verification

## Part 1

- Check if your SQL data source is available (in this case, simply an SQLite DB)
- Check if you can connect to the DB
- Ensure that the 3 tables exist
- If they do not exist, they should be created

## Part 2

In the context of SQLite, please check the table conventions again.. I believe it is PascalCase in MYSQL.. but in most databases, Snake Case is used, which I actually prefer
