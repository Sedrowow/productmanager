# Task 2

Database Connection and Table Verification

## Part 1

- Check if your SQL data source is available (in this case, simply an SQLite DB)
- Check if you can connect to the DB
- Ensure that the 3 tables exist
- If they do not exist, they should be created

## Part 2

In the context of SQLite, please check the table conventions again.. I believe it is PascalCase in MYSQL.. but in most databases, Snake Case is used, which I actually prefer
